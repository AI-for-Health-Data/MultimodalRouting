## Model Architecture

The overall architecture of the proposed **multimodal routing framework**
is illustrated in **Figure 1 of the paper**.

The model consists of:
- Modality-specific encoders for structured data (L), clinical notes (N), and chest X-rays (I)
- Explicit unimodal, directional bimodal, and trimodal routing paths
- Patient-specific route activations
- Label-specific routing coefficients for interpretable aggregation
